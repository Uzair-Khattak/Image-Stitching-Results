# Image-Stitching-Results

Hello everyone, in this repository we have for now only shared the results of our stitching algorithm which is made in Python. We used the same dataset to Microsoft ICE (Image composite editor) and compared our results with ICE results. In the ICE there is a color degradation issue (sharp colour variance) which does not appear in our images.

--> Code and complete results will be published soon !!
